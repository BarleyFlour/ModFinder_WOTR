Feel free to look through and edit it but expect things to crash if you do wonky stuff like to turn on Powerful Change on for a druid, or try to get someone to cast a spell they don't have.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=5]For Skidmarcanists:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />If you are an arcanist and casting an appropriate spell you can toggle \"Allow Share Transmutation\" and \"Use Powerful Change\". The mod [b]will[/b] spend the points from your arcane resevoir but does not (currently) predict them like it does spell slots.\n<br />\n<br />If you are using Share Transmutation and there are no points, the spell will be skipped.\n<br />If you are using Powerful Change and there are no points, the spell will be cast without it.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NOTE: The combat log will say these casts are successful, it is a known thing and will get fixed eventually.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to DeadMor0z for the contributions!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />如何使用：在任何能完整操控整个小队的地方，点开法术书右下角进入设置面板，先选择法术，然后在中间选择施法者，中间的右边选择这个施法所在的施法序列，最后在最下方选择施法目标。\n<br />设置好后，在游戏中任何时候点击左下角的三个按钮即可瞬间释放相应序列中所有设置好的法术。\n<br />此mod由1onepower翻译，你可以在 [url=https://space.bilibili.com/383719917?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0]B站[/url] 关注我,并且欢迎加入最大的中文CRPG社区之一：[url=https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E6%8B%A5%E7%8E%8B%E8%80%85&amp;fr=index]拥王者吧[/url]",
