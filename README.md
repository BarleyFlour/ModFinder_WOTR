# Modfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Modfinder is a mod-manager for Pathfinder Wrath of the righteous
Features include
>Automatically install and update mods at the press of a button (Due to Nexus' API this cannot be done with Nexus mods, can still check for updates though)
>Work as a "Library" to browse mods, so that mods that are not on the Nexus can still have some visibility
>Handle both types of mods, Namely UMM (Unity Mod Manager) and OwlcatModification (Owlcat Modding template for WOTR)
