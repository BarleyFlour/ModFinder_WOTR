# Modfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Modfinder is a mod-manager for Pathfinder Wrath of the righteous

Features include
>Automatically install and update mods at the press of a button (Due to Nexus' API this cannot be done with Nexus mods, can still check for updates though)
>Work as a "Library" to browse mods, so that mods that are not on the Nexus can still have some visibility
>Handle both types of mods, Namely UMM (Unity Mod Manager) and OwlcatModification (Owlcat Modding template for WOTR)

Setup:
>All that is needed is to enter your Nexus API Key and optionally a github API Key.
>Nexus API key can be acquired by going to the "site preferences" page on nexus, then clicking on the API tab, then scrolling down to "Personal API Key"
>Github API Key can be acquired by going to Settings, then developer settings, then Personal Access Tokens, then creating a new one.
